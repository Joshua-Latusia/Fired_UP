<h1 align="center">Fired Up - A Java Game with Wii controllers</h1>

## Overview
Fired up is a game I made during my first year with 5 other students.
The game is written in Java.
The game is played using a WiiMote and the Wii nunchuck per player. (2 players support).
We used the WiiuseJ library to read and send data between the application and the controllers.
